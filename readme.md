# thumbnail-maker

Generate thumbnails with Ubuntu 20.04, libreoffice, and imagemagick using a Python script.

Borrows some ideas form [libreoffice-thumb](https://github.com/lunared/libreoffice-thumb/). Another idea that would be good to borrow is using `inotifywait` to allow this to run in the background continuously producing thumbnails when the content changes.
